    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    age = 200;

    let name = "beeburrt";
    let name2 = name;
    name = "Brian";
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const team = players;
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[3] = "Lux";
    
    // now here is the problem!
    
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    // const team = players.slice();
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team = [].concat(players);
    team[3] = "Lux"
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    
    // console.log("team: ", team);
    // console.log("players: ", players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Brian Burt',
      age: 47
    };

    person.social = {
      twitter: "@beeburrt",
      insta: "@beeburrt"
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap2 = {...person};
    const cap2 = structuredClone(person);
    
    console.log(cap2);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
